            I am a developer with 
            <a
              class="s1dl0hk9"

              some experience
            </a>
             in the field (including consulting and product business). My main concern is with the front end of things (and UX).

          <p>
            My main stack (for now) is with TypeScript, React, redux and all things that go with them. For styling I mainly use styled-components or other libraries with similar syntax. For now, I've found that
             
            <a

              the Fractal pattern
            </a>
             
            is the only way to keep a large project logical. As an example, you can look at the
             
            <a
              class="s1dl0hk9"
              href="https://github.com/lapanti/lapanti.github.io"

              code of this page

            , to see what I'm talking about.

            I am currently happily employed, but because you still maybe want to see them, here's my

            I think later I will maybe do some writing here, but we shall see how much time I have on my hands (with two kids and a dog).
